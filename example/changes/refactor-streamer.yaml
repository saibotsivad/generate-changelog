  summary: CUE singleton location change # optional
  message: |
    Moved the deletion of the CUE singleton from the cleanup script into the integration test so
    it can be properly tested.
- type: fix
  scope: init
  semver: patch
  message: |
    Modifies parts of the system where deleting a school singleton was failing because it was forced to be
    published. If a singleton exists, they MUST be published. However, if they are to be destroyed, they
    should also be expired.
