change:
  - Moved the deletion of the CUE singleton from the cleanup script into the integration test so
    it can be properly tested.
fix:
  - Modifies parts of the system where deleting a school singleton was failing because it was forced to be
    published. If a singleton exists, they MUST be published. However, if they are to be destroyed, they
    should also be expired.
